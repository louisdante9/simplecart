Due to time constrain, I was not able to add tests for the frontend.

## Technologies
* [ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/): This is the newest version of JavsScript with new features such as arrow functions, spread and rest operators and many more.
* [REACT](https://facebook.github.io/react/): REACT is a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook and it is used for developing web application. REACT is the 'VIEW' in the MVC architecture.
* [REDUX](): Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [Babel:](https://babeljs.io/): Babel is used to transpile es6 down to es5.
* [Webpack:](https://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html): Webpack is used to bundle modules with dependencies and run mundane tasks.
* [Apollo Client:](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/): Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.

## Notes
    So much more can be done to improve this code base such as unit testing and removal of the redux state management tool then by allowing the full using of apollo client capabities but i decided to use both to showcase both skills and understanding on the different tools.
